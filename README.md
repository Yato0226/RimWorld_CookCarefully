Adds a bill at stoves to cook a simple meal carefully. This will take 33% more time than normal, but has two benefits: learning rate is increased by 25%, and if the meal is poisonous, it will be discarded. Great for low skill cooks, so that they can learn cooking without poisioning the entire colony.
